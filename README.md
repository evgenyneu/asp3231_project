## Steps

### Reduce Bias and Dark frames

Run `code/Bias and Dark/Bias and Dark/Bias and Dark.ipynb` to create bias_median.fits and dark_median.fits files in `code/Bias and Dark/Bias and Dark`.

### Reduce flat frames

* Copy bias_median.fits and dark_median.fits from `code/Bias and Dark/Bias and Dark` into `code/flat_and_science_reduction/data`.

* Run `code/flat_and_science_reduction/flats.ipynb`.

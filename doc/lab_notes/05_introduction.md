# Logbooks

Our object: NGC 3201

* Show images and stats (mean, std) after each reduction step.
* Can submit one logbook and report.
* Reflect on result.
* Submit logbooks are not marked: 7, 21, 4 June. Don't need to submit previous logbooks.


## Goals

* Globular cluster - age and distance (latter with red giants).

* Use Girardi isochrones for ages 10^9 to 10^10 years.


## Q and A with Vaishali

Flats, biases and darks can be from different nights.

* Darks. Use 10 min or 600 sec darks. Use 20 darks. Check temperature, around -5 C, don't use fluctuating temp. Make a list of darks we are using and nights. Science images and darks should have the same temperature within 0.5 degrees.

* Flats. Check flats, make sure there are no stars. Don't stack flats from different nights. How many available use them, 5 is ok.

* Biases don't matter. Stack 10 biases.

* B, I, R, U, V filters. Just use three filters (U is not used).

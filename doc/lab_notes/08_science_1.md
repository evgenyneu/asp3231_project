# Science 1

* Find age and distance

* Use table for star types, masses and absolute 060_find_magnitudes

## distance

m-M = 5 log(d/10) + A, (1)

Use A=0 for now

### Find abslute magnitude Mv

* Find turning point off the main sequnce, calculate B-V value, look at Carol and Ostlie to find absolute magnitude Mv.

* PLot B-V vs absolute magnitude Mv from Carol and Ostlie table

Find d from Eq. 1.


## Age

t = M / L

L prop = M^3.5

t propto M^{-2.5}

Get mass from C&O table. Use Sun's age and mass, and proportion to find t.

Plot B-V vs M/M_sun


## IMF (only for open cluster)

Use our function to calculate stellar mass vs B-V.

Make histogram M/M_sun (at least one star in each bin).

* Plot log(number) vs log(M/M_sun)

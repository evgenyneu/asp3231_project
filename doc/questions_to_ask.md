## Week 6 Data reduction

* Is 20 biases ok, or should we use 10?

* The I-filter images (March_09_2018/NGC_3201_I_60.000secs_00001617.fits) are oversaturated. Should we drop them from analysis?

* Is it enough to use science images just from one nights (about 20 images for each filter)? Or should add stack images from other nights?

* When I blink through reduced images, I can still see hot pixels that we exactly at same positions on all frames. Those pixels will not be removed after median-combining images. What should we do?

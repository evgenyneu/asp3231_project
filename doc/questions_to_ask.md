## Difference between SIMAD's and my magnitudes of reference stars are:

* B mag: 0.06 ± 0.05
* V mag: -0.12 ± 0.04

Are they bad?

## Do we need to calculate magnitude uncertainties?

## The difference between magnitudes of reference stars in photometric and non-photometric are shown in Table 4. Are they good?

Table 4: Mean standard deviations of differences of magnitudes of reference stars between photometric and non-photometric images.
---------------------
B:   -0.00 ± 0.11 mag
V:   -0.00 ± 0.04 mag
R:   -0.00 ± 0.04 mag
I:    0.00 ± 0.04 mag

## Is our CMDs ok?

## Should we calculate uncertainties of magnitudes?

## Can we use Girardi isochrones?

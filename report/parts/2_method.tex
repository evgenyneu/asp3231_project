\subsection{I wanted to be part of something larger}

For alongside our famous individualism, there's another ingredient in the American saga \citep{bessell2005standard}. I was too young to be involved in that movement, but I felt I could play a small part in the continuing battle for justice by helping rebuild some of Chicago's poorest neighborhoods. That is one option. In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships. And while America in the past has focused on oil and gas in this part of the world, we now seek a broader engagement.

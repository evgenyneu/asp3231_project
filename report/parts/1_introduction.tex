\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Thank you, and God bless America}

America! Tonight, if you feel the same energy that I do, if you feel the same urgency that I do, if you feel the same passion I do, if you feel the same hopefulness that I do - if we do what we must do, then I have no doubts that all across the country, from Florida to Oregon, from Washington to Maine, the people will rise up in November, and John Kerry will be sworn in as president, and John Edwards will be sworn in as vice president, and this country will reclaim its promise, and out of this long political darkness a brighter day will come. And throughout history, Islam has demonstrated through words and deeds the possibilities of religious tolerance and racial equality \citep{1992ASPC...23...68G}:

\begin{equation}
  \vec{E}(\vec{r}) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \int \rho(\vec{r}') \frac{\vec{r} - \vec{r}'}{|\vec{r} - \vec{r}'|^3} d\vec{r}'.
  \label{eq_q2_coulumbs_law_superposition}
\end{equation}


\subsection{A common dream, born of two continents.}

It's not enough, but it's helping \citep{2018A&A...616A...1G}. He's still speaking to our Catholic friends - who are holding up a consistent ethic of life that goes beyond abortion - one that includes a respect for life and dignity whether it's in Iraq, in poor neighborhoods, in African villages or even on death row. A lack of economic opportunity among black men, and the shame and frustration that came from not being able to provide for one's family, contributed to the erosion of black families - a problem that welfare policies for many years may have worsened (shown on \autoref{fig_barack_fishing}). This time we want to talk about the shuttered mills that once provided a decent life for men and women of every race, and the homes for sale that once belonged to Americans from every religion, every region, every walk of life. Of course, recognizing our common humanity is only the beginning of our task.

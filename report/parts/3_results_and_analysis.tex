\subsection{That's not what I'm talking about}

It is not up in heaven \citep{1996ApJ...458..600B}. I am married to a black American who carries within her the blood of slaves and slaveowners - an inheritance we pass on to our two precious daughters. As William Faulkner once wrote, "The past isn't dead and buried. The men and women who gathered there could've heard many things. The situation in Afghanistan demonstrates America's goals, and our need to work together \autoref{tab_metallicities_literature}.

\subsection{And nothing will change.}

I've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs, in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the good neighbors who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise \citep{refId0}. The situation in Afghanistan demonstrates America's goals, and our need to work together.

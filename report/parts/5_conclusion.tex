\section{Conclusion}

But at the end of the day, we cannot walk away - not for the sake of passing a bill, but so that we can finally address the real concerns of Americans and the persistent hopes of all those brothers and sisters who want nothing more than their own chance at our common dream. And you know what - it's worked before.

What we have already achieved gives us hope - the audacity to hope - for what we can and must achieve tomorrow. I would not be running for President if I didn't believe with all my heart that this is what the vast majority of Americans want for this country. But it is where we start. And when innocents in Bosnia and Darfur are slaughtered, that is a stain on our collective conscience.
